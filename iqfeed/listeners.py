"""
Listener classes to listen to messages from IQFeed.

You connect to IQFeed using one of the XXXConn classes. For things
like historical data, when you request the data the data is returned
as the return value of the requesting functions. However when you
request something like real-time tick data, which may come at some
indeterminate time in the future, the connection classes send you
the data by calling callbacks on listeners. In addition even the
connection classes which return data immediately may call callbacks
in listeners for things like a status message telling you the feed
disconnected.

This file contains abstract base classes for a few different types of these
listeners. python's abc mechanism (PEP 3141) was deliberately NOT used since
it doesn't provide any benefit for this use but add a lot of needless
complexity. This being python, duck-typing rules so you don't HAVE to derive
from one of these ABCs.

There is a SilentListener and a VerboseListener version for each listener.
The SilentListeners do nothing, so if you want to handle only one message
type, you could derive from one of these and override one specific function.
The VerboseListeners print a message to stdout every time they get a message
so if you don't override a callback and the callback gets called you will see
output.
